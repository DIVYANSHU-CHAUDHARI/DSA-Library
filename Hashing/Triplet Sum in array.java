//Using the two-pointer theorem, we can find out a pair with a given sum in an array in O(n)

//1.Sort the given array.
//2.Loop over the array and fix the first element of the possible triplet, arr[i].
//3.Then fix two pointers, one at i + 1 and the other at n â€“ 1. And look at the sum, 
//4.If the sum is smaller than the required number, increment the first pointer.
//5.Else, If the sum is bigger, decrease the end pointer to reduce the sum.
//6.Else, if the sum of elements at two-pointer is equal to given number return true.
